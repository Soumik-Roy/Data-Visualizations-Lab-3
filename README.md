# DV_Lab_3

To fetch all code to your system run the below commands:

Gitlab code : 

```
git clone https://git.iitj.ac.in/roy.9/dv_lab_3.git
```

Github code : 

```
git clone https://github.com/Soumik-Roy/Data-Visualizations-Lab-3.git
```
Go to B20AI042_Lab_Assignment_3.ipynb file, and run all cells and you will see all the outputs, nothing else is required.

* Note * : If you are running the ipynb on your local system, then the git clone will create a cloned folder of my github repository. You can delete this folder once all the code has executed.
